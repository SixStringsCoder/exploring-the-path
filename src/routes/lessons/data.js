		intro: `
		<p class="english-para">The first part of this collection endeavors to point out the rarity of something that seems far too natural: That in the present period of existence we as human beings are able to encounter the magnificent result oriented and beneficial teaching of the Enlightened One. While aeons after aeons pass in darkness, we encounter a remedy not only on the level of theoretical understanding and philosophical satisfaction but also as a real and applicable practice through the gem that is so generously presented in Vipassana.</p> 
		<p class="english-para">When the inherent qualities of Dhamma mature within one who walks on the path as described by the Buddha, especially the quality of <span class="pali">ehipassiko</span> manifests itself along with the zeal of sharing with many the benefits and the merits one has gained.</p> 
		<p class="english-para">The sole desire to help other beings has been the arduous dedication of the Buddha during an unthinkable period of four <span class="pali">asaṅkhiye</span> and hundred thousand <span class="pali">kappas: Kappe ca satasahasse, caturo ca asaṅkhiye*amaraṃ nāma nagaraṃ, dassaneyyaṃ manoramaṃ</span>. This desire to help other beings caused him then as Samaṇa Sumedha to prostrate at the feet of Buddha Dīpankara and to express his aspiration to become a Sammasambuddha himself. This desire to help other beings had been the singular reason to relinquish his own possible enlightenment with the thought:</p>
    <section class="pali-section">
			<p class="pali">Kiṃ me ekena tiṇṇena, purisena thāmadassinā; sabbaññutaṃ pāpuṇitvā, santāressaṃ sadevakaṃ.</p> 
		  <p class="pali-trans">What is the use if I alone should cross, a man aware of my possibilities? Once I will have reached omniscience I will help all including devas to cross to the other shore.</p>
		</section>
		<p class="english-para">It was his desire to help and enable other beings to realise the ultimate benefit, which is <span class="pali">nibbāna</span>: <span class="pali">Tattha atthāyāti iminā paramatthāya, nibbānāyāti vuttaṃ hoti</span>. It was his desire to help other beings to present the path that, once applied enables one to reach the highest wellbeing, which is <span class="pali">nibbāna</span>: <span class="pali">Hitāyāti taṃsampāpakamaggatthāyāti vuttaṃ hoti. Nibbānasampāpakamaggato hi uttariṃ hitaṃ nāmanatthi</span>. It was his desire to help and enable other beings to realise that very happiness through the successful attainment of entering the stream towards <span class="pali">nibbāna: Sukhāyāti phalasamāpattisukhatthāyāti vuttaṃ hoti, tato uttari sukhābhāvato</span>.</p>
		<p class="english-para">This zeal of sharing one’s merits develops as the result of one’s own walking on the path of Dhamma, which in itself is: -<span class="pali">ādikalyāṇaṃ majjhekalyāṇaṃ pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ</span>- beneficial from the very beginning, in the middle and beneficial all through to the very end.</p> 
		<p class="english-para">One starts realizing that enormous benefits are already derived by starting observing the moral principles of <span class="pali">sīla</span>, these benefits multiply once one starts practicing Vipassana and reach their peak in realizing <span class="pali">nibbāna: sāsanadhammo attano atthabhūtena sīlena ādikalyāṇo, samathavipassanāmaggaphalehi majjhekalyāṇo, nibbānena pariyosānakalyāṇo</span>-. One tastes the beauty of Dhamma from the very beginning through <span class="pali">sīla</span> and <span class="pali">samādhi</span>, in the middle through Vipassana and the path, in the end by realizing the fruit: -<span class="pali">sīlasamādhīhi vā ādikalyāṇo, vipassanāmaggehi majjhekalyāṇo, phalanibbānehi pariyosānakalyāṇo</span>-. The beauty of Dhamma presents itself in the truly enlightened Buddha, in a Dhamma that is pure, and a Saṅgha that practices uprightly: -<span class="pali">buddhasubuddhatāya vā ādikalyāṇo, dhammasudhammatāya majjhekalyāṇo, saṅghasuppaṭipattiyā pariyosānakalyāṇo</span>-.</p>
		<p class="english-para">May the <span class="pali">Bahujanahitasuttaṃ</span> inspire many beings to walk on the path, realize its benefits and share these with many other beings!</p>

		<p class="english-para">When these three kinds of individuals arise in the world, they arise for the well-being of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, the welfare and happiness of gods and men.</p>

		<p class="english-para">Here, oh Bhikkhus, the Tathagata arises in the world, an Arahant, a fully Enlightened One, perfect in knowledge and conduct, having reached the final goal, seeing the entire universe, an incomparable trainer of mankind, a teacher of Gods and men, an Enlightened One, a Bhagavā. He teaches the Dhamma which is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with correct wording full of meaning, complete in itself, utterly pure and displaying the holy life.</p>
		<p class="english-para">This, oh Bhikkhus, is the first kind of individual that when they arise in the world, they arise for the well-being of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, the welfare and happiness of gods and men.</p>
		<p class="english-para">Next, oh Bhikkhus, there is a disciple of that teacher who is himself an Arahant—one who has destroyed all impurities, brought himself to perfection and done what ought to be done, laid down the burden and attained his own welfare, shattered the bondages of becoming and is realised through complete knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma which is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, it possesses meaning and is well phrased, complete in itself, utterly pure and displaying the holy life.</p>
		<p class="english-para">This, oh Bhikkhus, is the second kind of individual that when they arise in the world, they arise for the well-being of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, the welfare and happiness of Gods and men.</p>
		<p class="english-para">Further Bhikkhus, there is a disciple of that teacher, under training, full of learning and established in the rules of good conduct. He teaches the Dhamma which is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with correct wording full of meaning, complete in itself, utterly pure and displaying the holy life.</p>
		<p class="english-para">This, oh Bhikkhus, is the third kind of individual that when they arise in the world, they arise for the well-being of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, the welfare and happiness of Gods and men.</p>

They rather try to indicate the contents in order to give the reader a quick idea about it. The footnotes here will give the direct and literal translation. The word <span class="pali">sutta</span> remains untranslated. Its meaning is:thread, text, line of…- and relates in general to the narrational dialogues, mainly collected in the Sutta-piṭaka.</p>

				footnote: `<p class="footnote-para">All the suttas starting with <span class="pali">vuttañhetaṃ</span>—this has been said—refer to the female slave of Queen <span class="pali">Samāvāti</span> by the name <span class="pali">Khujjhuttarā</span> in Kosambī. The name <span class="pali">Khujjhuttarā</span> was given to her because she had been born with a deformed back (<span class="pali">khujja</span>- bent). It is said that in one of her past lives she had imitated a Pacceka Buddha, who was a hunchback. Despite her position as a slave-girl (because in another previous life she had treated a nun like her servant-girl) she had the capacity of quick understanding and the ability to memorize whatever she heard. This was a result of a situation when she proved fast thinking in a previous life, where she quickly presented bracelets to Pacceka Buddhas, who had trouble holding extremely hot food in their bowls). Her main duty under queen <span class="pali">Samāvāti</span> had been to procure a fresh bouquet of flowers everyday. It had been her habit to buy only half a bunch of flowers and to keep the other half of money for herself. This attitude changed when she listened to a discourse of the Buddha one day, which inspired her to present the correct amount of flowers to the queen. The queen was surprised by the large amount of beautiful flowers on that day and was accordingly informed about the past bad habit. But instead of rebuking <span class="pali">Kujjhuttarā</span>, the Queen <span class="pali">Samāvāti</span> instructed her with a new task: From hence on she had to go and listen to the discourses of the Buddha and to repeat them to her every day. The collection of these suttas constitutes the <span class="pali">Itivuttakapāḷi</span>.</p>`

Before the first rains retreat the Buddha stirred them with the following words to spread the Dhamma : ‘Caratha, bhikkhave, cārikaṃ bahujanahitāya bahujanasukhāya lokānukampāya atthāya hitāya sukhāya devamanussānaṃ; mā ekena dve agamittha; desetha, bhikkhave, dhammaṃ ādikalyāṇaṃ majjhekalyāṇaṃ pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ sātthaṃ sabyañjanaṃ kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ parisuddhaṃ brahmacariyaṃ pakāsetha.’—“Wander forth, Bhikkhus, for the wellbeing of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, the welfare and happiness of gods and men. No two should wander together the same direction. Proclaim, Bhikkhus, the Dhamma which is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with correct wording full of meaning, complete in itself, utterly pure and displaying the holy life.” (see Vinaya, Mahāvaggo)`

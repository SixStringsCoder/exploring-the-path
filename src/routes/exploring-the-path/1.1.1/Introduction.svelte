  <p class="indent">The reknown meditation teacher S.N. Goenka labelled ‘pariyatti’, the study of the words of the Buddha, the original Pāli-suttas the ‘gold’ that embellishes the ‘gem’ of ‘paṭipatti’, the beneficial practise of meditation. In this sense all quotes, suttas and selections of pariyatti in this ‘Exploring the Path in the Direct Words of the Buddha’<sup>2</sup> along with the introduction and voaculary training intend to provide inspiration to practise. It is ONLY application of paṭipatti which in the end will provide all real, concrete and palpable benefits for oneself, with pariyatti rendering encouragement, motivation and thrill.</p>

<p class="indent">For providing thrill the first chapter of this collection endeavours to point out the rarity of something that seems far too natural:</p> 
  
<blockquote class="justified-indented-quote">
<p><strong><em>The good fortune for human beings in the present period of existence being able to encounter the magnificent, result oriented and beneficial teaching of the Enlightened One!</strong></em></p>
<p>While aeons after aeons do pass in darkness, mankind currently encounters a remedy not only on the level of theoretical understanding and philosophical satisfaction but also as real and applicable practise through the ‘gem’ that is so generously presented in Vipassana<sup>3</sup></p>.
</blockquote> 
  
<blockquote class="justified-indented-quote">What is the use if I alone should cross, a man aware of my possibilities? Once I will have reached omniscience I will help all including devas to cross to the other shore. 
</blockquote>  

<p>After the Buddha had ordained his first five disciples, the noble youth Yasa and his friends, the number of Arahants had grown up to sixty-one. Before the first rains retreat the Buddha stirred them with the following words to spread the Dhamma:</p>
<p class="pali">‘Caratha, bhikkhave, cārikaṃ bahujanahitāya bahujanasukhāya lokānukampāya atthāya hitāya sukhāya devamanussānaṃ; mā ekena dve agamittha; desetha, bhikkhave, dhammaṃ ādikalyāṇaṃ majjhekalyāṇaṃ pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ sātthaṃ sabyañjanaṃ kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ<sup>4</sup>  parisuddhaṃ brahmacariyaṃ pakāsetha.’<sup>5</sup></p> 
<p>‘Wander forth, Bhikkhus, for the wellbeing of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, the welfare and happiness of gods and men. No two should wander together the same direction. Proclaim, Bhikkhus, the Dhamma which is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with correct wording full of meaning, complete in itself, utterly pure and displaying the holy life.
</p> 
  
<p>
  The opening text of this Pāli-learning-programme, the Bahujanahitasutta is selected from the Itivuttakapāḷi, a collection of all suttas that begin with ‘vuttañhetaṃ’—‘this has been said’.<sup>6</sup> It is the fifth sutta from the chapter under the title —‘tikanipāto’— ‘things with three’ The three things described in this sutta are the three individuals who arise for the benefit and welfare of all beings, —‘bahujanahitaya’— the Buddha, the Tathagata<sup>7</sup>, an Arahant and a disciple, able to teach the Dhamma.</p>
<p>‘Vuttañhetaṃ’—‘this has been said’—refers to the female slave of Queen Samāvāti by the name Khujjhuttarā in Kosambī. The name Khujjhuttarā was given to her because she had been born with a deformed back (khujja—bent). It is said that in one of her past lives she had imitated a Pacceka Buddha, who was a hunchback. Despite her position as a slave-girl (because in another previous life she had treated a nun like her servant-girl) she had the capacity of quick understanding and the ability to memorize whatever she heard. This was a result of a situation when she proved fast thinking in a previous life, where she quickly presented bracelets to Pacceka Buddhas, who had trouble holding extremely hot food in their bowls.</p>
<p>Her main duty under queen Samāvāti had been to procure a fresh bouquet of flowers everyday. It had been her habit to buy only half a bunch of flowers and to keep the other half of money for herself. This attitude changed when she listened to a discourse of the Buddha one day, which inspired her to present the correct amount of flowers to the queen. The queen was surprised by the large amount of beautiful flowers on that day and was accordingly informed about the past bad habit. But instead of rebuking Kujjhuttarā, the Queen Samāvāti instructed her with a new task: From hence on she had to go and listen to the discourses of the Buddha and to repeat them to her every day.
</p>
  
<p>When the inherent qualities of Dhamma mature within one who treads the path as described by the Buddha then the value of ehipassiko<sup>8</sup> usually manifests within. One develops the zeal of sharing with many the benefits —‘bahujanahitaya’— and merits one has gained oneself as a result of applying the Dhamma.</p>  
<p>The sole desire to help other beings has been the arduous dedication of the Buddha that he fostered during an unthinkable period of four asaṅkheyye<sup>9</sup> and hundred thousand kappas<sup>10</sup>: 
</p>
  
<blockquote class="justified-indented-quote">
<span class="pali">Kappe ca satasahasse<sup>11</sup>, caturo ca asaṅkhiya; 
amaraṃ nāma nagaraṃ, dassaneyyaṃ manoramaṃ<sup>12</sup>.  
</span>.
</blockquote> 
  
<blockquote class="justified-indented-quote">Hundred thousand aeons and four incalculabels ago there was a delightful city by the name of Amara<sup>13</sup>, pleasant to the eye.  
</blockquote>
  
<p>This desire to help other beings caused the Buddha, then as Samaṇa Sumedha, to prostate at the feet of Buddha Dīpankara and to express his aspiration to become a Sammasambuddha himself. This desire to help other beings had been the singular reason to relinquish the possible enlightenment for himself with the thought:</p>
  
<blockquote class="justified-indented-quote">
<span class="pali">‘Kiṃ me ekena tiṇṇena<sup>14</sup>, purisena thāmadassinā<sup>15</sup>; 
sabbaññutaṃ pāpuṇitvā, santāressaṃ<sup>16</sup> sadevakaṃ.’<sup>17</sup>  
</blockquote> 
  
<blockquote class="justified-indented-quote">‘What is the use if I alone should cross, a man seeing my powers? Once I will have reached omniscience I will help all beings including devas to cross to the other shore.’  
</blockquote>  

<p>It was his desire to help and enable other beings to realise the ultimate benefit, which is nibbāna: Tattha atthāyāti iminā paramatthāya<sup>18</sup>, nibbānāyāti vuttaṃ hoti.<sup>19</sup></p>  
<p>It was his desire to help other beings to present the path that, once applied enables one to reach the highest wellbeing, which is nibbāna: 
</p> 
<blockquote class="justified-indented-quote pali">
Hitāyāti taṃsampāpakamaggatthāyāti<sup>20</sup> vuttaṃ hoti.  Nibbānasampāpakamaggato  hi uttariṃ hitaṃ nāmanatthi.  
</blockquote>   

<p>It was his desire to help and enable other beings to realise that very happiness through the successful attainment of entering the stream towards nibbāna:</p>

<blockquote class="justified-indented-quote pali">
Sukhāyāti  phalasamāpattisukhatthāyāti<sup>21</sup> vuttaṃ  hoti, <br>
tato uttari sukhābhāvato.  
</blockquote>   

<p>All this zeal of sharing one’s merits develops as the result of one’s own walking on the path of Dhamma, which in itself is beneficial, supportive and leading to welfarein three ways:</p>
  
<blockquote class="justified-indented-quote pali">
‘ādikalyāṇaṃ majjhekalyāṇaṃ  pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ’   
</blockquote>   

<blockquote class="justified-indented-quote">
‘beneficial from the very beginning, in the middle and beneficial all through to the very end’    
</blockquote> 
  
<p>One starts realizing that enormous benefits are already derived by starting to observe the moral principles of sīla, these benefits multiply once one starts practicing the calmimg meditation of Vipassana and reach their peak in realizing the fruit of nibbāna:</p>  
  
<blockquote class="justified-indented-quote pali">
 … ‘sāsanadhammo attano  atthabhūtena  sīlena  ādikalyāṇo,  samathavipassanāmaggaphalehi majjhekalyāṇo, nibbānena pariyosānakalyāṇ’  
</blockquote> 
 
<p>One tastes the beauty of Dhamma from the very beginning through sīla and samādhi, in the middle through Vipassana and the path, in the end by realizing the fruit: </p>  
 
<blockquote class="justified-indented-quote pali">
… ‘sīlasamādhīhi vā ādikalyāṇo, vipassanāmaggehi  majjhekalyāṇo, phalanibbānehi pariyosānakalyāṇo’   
</blockquote> 
  
<p>The beauty of Dhamma presents itself in the truly enlightened Buddha, in a Dhamma that is pure, and a Saṅgha that practices uprightly: </p>  
  
<blockquote class="justified-indented-quote pali">
… ‘buddhasubuddhatāya vā ādikalyāṇo,   dhammasudhammatāya   majjhekalyāṇo,   saṅghasuppaṭipattiyā   pariyosānakalyāṇo’  
</blockquote>  
  
<p>May this first selected sutta, the Bahujanahitasuttaṃ inspire many beings to walk on the path, realize its benefits that are: — ‘ādikalyāṇaṃ majjhekalyāṇaṃ  pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ’ — and may these be shared with many other beings!</p>

    <li>After the Buddha had ordained his first five disciples, the noble youth Yasa and his friends, the
number of Arahants had grown up to sixty-one. Before the first rains retreat the Buddha stirred them
with the following words to spread the Dhamma : ‘Caratha, bhikkhave, cārikaṃ bahujanahitāya
bahujanasukhāya lokānukampāya atthāya hitāya sukhāya devamanussānaṃ; mā ekena dve agamittha; desetha,
bhikkhave, dhammaṃ ādikalyāṇaṃ majjhekalyāṇaṃ pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ sātthaṃ sabyañjanaṃ
kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ parisuddhaṃ brahmacariyaṃ pakāsetha.’—“Wander forth, Bhikkhus, for the wellbeing of
many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, the welfare and
happiness of gods and men. No two should wander together the same direction. Proclaim, Bhikkhus, the
Dhamma which is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with
correct wording full of meaning, complete in itself, utterly pure and displaying the holy life.” (see
Vinaya, Mahāvaggo)</li>
<li>lokānukampāya: lit.:trembling along with, i.e. having compassion, out of pity for (the suffering
in) the world</li>
<li>bhikkhave, here untranslated as :– ‘oh Bhikkhus’—is generally the term the Buddha used to
address his assembly, which often consisted not only of monks and nuns, but of laypeople as well.</li>
<li>The expression tathāgato is a term that the Buddha uses whenever he talks about himself. It can
be derived from tathā gata ( having gone thus. i.e. having gone the path to enlightenment from the
beginning to the end ) as well as from tatha āgata ( having come thus. i.e. having attained the state of
enlightenment by the path he and all the Buddhas have proclaimed). For more details of the qualities of tathāgato refer to Lokasuttaṃ and Kāḷakārāmasuttaṃ in Aṅguttaranikāyo, CatukkanipātapāḷI,
Paṭhamapaṇṇāsakaṃ, Uruvelavaggo.</li>
<li>The following qualities of the Buddha usually start with “itipiso bhagavato arahato
sammāsambuddho…” and illustrate and frame together with the qualities of Dhamma “svakkhato bhagavato
dhammo…” and the qualities of Sangha “supattipanno bhagavato savaka sangho…” the homage “vandana” to
the Triple Gem. The inspiration derived for one's own practice out of properly understanding these
qualities is called Buddhanusati, Dhammanusati and Sanghanusati. These ‘-anusati’ are explained in great
detail in the Visudhimaggo.</li>
<li>The chapter of Buddhanusati in the Visudhimaggo deals in great detail with the deriviation of
roots and meanings of each of these epitepths. For example the word arahat can be derived in various
ways. Araha means—deserving, worthy-: arahat is someone worthy of one’s veneration. ara also takes the
connotation of a -spoke of a wheel- and hari describes -an enemy-, hata or hanta are derived from the
word hanati—to kill, destroy, so the word arahat is understood as: -somebody, who has destroyed these
spokes (of the wheel of becoming) and killed his enemies.</li>
<li>The term vijjacarana is translated as theory and practice. A practitioner should understand that
carana consists of sīla and samadhi and vijja of panna. A simile compares vijja with the the eye of a human
being while carana resembles the limbs. In the same sense as a person is only perfect with good eyesight
and fully-functioning limbs, a practitioner of Dhamma should therefore establish oneself in carana by
developing proper concentration with a base of perfect moral behaviour as well as vijja, developing one’s
own wisdom through insight.</li>
<li> Literally sugato means -well gone-, but could also be derived for example from sobhaṇa-gamana
(his pefect manner of trodding the path), sammā gata (having gone rightly without derivation) etc. For
another explanation of sugato –well spoken- derived from sammā gadati see sutta 2.3.20.</li>
<li> Refer to commentarial explanation of bhagavā: for example in: Maṅgalasuttavaṇṇanā,
Nikkhepappayojanaṃ: Bhaggarāgo bhaggadoso, bhaggamoho anāsavo; Bhaggāssa pāpakā dhammā,
bhagavā tena vuccatī”ti—Having abolished desire, aversion and delusion, freed from impurities, rid of all
evil states- such a One is rightly called a Bhagavā.</li>
<li> Brahmacariyaṃ is here translated as ‘holy life’. One who decides to lead the ‘life of a brahma’ in
the sense of a bhikkhu who leaves the household and is expected to accomplish the precepts as laid out
in the Vinaya. For a householder the third precept means full abstention from sexual activities:
Abrahmacariyā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi - ‘I undertake the rule of training to live a life of
chastity’. For examples compare Majjhimanikā, MūlapaṇṇāsapāḷI, Mahāyamakavaggo, Cūḷasāropamasuttaṃ
and Mahāsāropamasuttaṃ or the Brahmacariyasuttaṃ in: Aṅguttaranikāyo, Catukkanipātapāḷi, Uruvelavaggo.</li>
<li> khīṇāsavo: an epithet for a person, an Arahant, whose mind is freed from all the four mental
obsessions, i.e. kāmāsava. bhavāsava, diṭṭhāsava, avijjāsava—desire for sensuality, desire for living,
attachement to philosophical speculations, and ignorance.</li>
<li> The expression: sātthaṃ sabyañjanaṃ can be translated purely literal: ‘with—sa- meaning, with
differentiation’. Attha has a wide variety of meanings (goal, benefit, meaning,…) and byañjana is
understood as letter, characteristic mark. The common translation is: ‘the spirit and the letter’. The
translation: ‘with correct wording full of meaning’ tries to convey the sense of the commentarial
explanations. The commentary relates sātthaṃ to paṭipatti and elucidates that the explanation of meaning
should be satisfying and inspiring to any wise person through it’s profoundness and purity of
explanation. Sabyañjanaṃ is related to pariyatti , it should be eliminating all doubts amongst worldly folks
and generate faith through the profoundness of teaching, analytical exegesis and proper placement of
words: Yaṃ pana bhagavā dhammaṃ desento sāsanabrahmacariyaṃ maggabrahmacariyañca pakāseti,
nānānayehi dīpeti, taṃ yathānurūpaṃ atthasampattiyā sātthaṃ, byañjanasampattiyā sabyañjanaṃ. Saṅkāsana,
pakāsana, vivaraṇa, vibhajana, uttānīkaraṇa paññatti atthapadasamāyogato sātthaṃ,
akkharapadabyañjanākāraniruttiniddesasampattiyā sabyañjanaṃ, atthagambhīratāpaṭivedhagambhīratāhi vā
sātthaṃ, dhammagambhīratādesanāgambhīratāhi sabyañjanaṃ. Atthapaṭibhānapaṭisambhidāvisayato vā
sātthaṃ, dhammaniruttipaṭisambhidāvisayato sabyañjanaṃ. Paṇḍitavedanīyato parikkhakajanappasādakanti
sātthaṃ, saddheyyato lokiyajanappasādakanti sabyañjanaṃ. Gambhīrādhippāyato sātthaṃ, uttānapadato
sabyañjanaṃ. Upanetabbassa abhāvato sakalaparipuṇṇabhāvena kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ, apanetabbassa abhāvato
niddosabhāvena parisuddhaṃ, apica paṭipattiyā adhigamabyattito sātthaṃ, pariyattiyā āgamabyattito
sabyañjana…… Tasmā “sātthaṃ sabyañjanaṃ …pe… pakāsetī”ti vuccati.
When the Bhagavā, teaching the Dhamma, declares the holy life of the dispensation and the holy
life of walking on the path, he throws light on it in manifold ways: if corresponding to the
comprehension of the meaning: it is sātthaṃ, if corresponding to the comprehension of the letter: it is
sabyañjanaṃ. Giving explanation, making known, uncovering, going into detail, clarification, description
with the motto of conjunction: this is sātthaṃ; for the comprehension of letters and words, the
explanation and analytical exegesis of letters and forms: it is sabyañjanaṃ.
Because of depth of meaning, profoundness of comprehension: it is sātthaṃ ; because of depth of
Dhamma and profoundness of teaching: it is sabyañjanaṃ. Because of illumination of meaning, analytical
knowledge in the sphere of meaning in extension: it is sātthaṃ; because of grammatical analyses in the
field of casual relation, explanation of the origin of words, it is sabyañjanaṃ. Leading to comprehension
amongst the wise ones and making it bright to investigating beings: it is sātthaṃ; inspiring faith and
making it bright to the worldly people: it is sabyañjanaṃ.
Profound in inference: it is sātthaṃ; clear in words: it is sabyañjanaṃ.
It should bring to conclusion, not be in want of anything, it should be entire, complete and
developed, fulfilled in it’s entity, it should remove (faults), not be in want of anything, faultless pure and
developed, utterly pure and further more through paṭipatti lead to the manifestation of knowledge: it is
sātthaṃ, through pariyatti it should be for the accomplishment of scriptures: it is
sabyañjanaṃ……Therefore it is said: “He teaches …… pe …… with correct wording full of meaning.”</li>
<li> ‘ti: The oral tradition indicates with the syllable : ‘ti’ the end of a quotation, today often shown
by quotation marks. ‘ti’ therefore remains untranslated. If the preceding word ends in ‘ṃ’ -
(devamanussānaṃ)- the pronunciation rules demand the change from ‘ṃti’ to the dental: ‘nti’:
saddhammassavanaṃ + ti’ : saddhammassavananti</li>
<li> The expression: Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca—The Bhagava explained this matter—in general
concludes the prose part of the words of the Buddha. The following expression: Tatthetaṃ iti vuccati —… in
connection of which this was stated…- introduces verses that are then added in this connection to
summarise the meaning in verse.</li>
